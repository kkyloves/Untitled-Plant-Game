# Crops vs Chickens

This game is made in 1 week by John Karlo Maninang for his Boomzaps' Coding Exam.

This is a 2D Top Down Planting Game, Vampire Survivor kind of theme. Where you deal with a horde of Chickens trying 
to kill you. The only way you can defend yourself is by planting crops that have a unique killing style.

The basic gameplay is basically dodging every chicken and killing them by planting crops.
Plant Crops, Kill Chickens, Loot seeds, Kill More Chickens, Gain Exp, Upgrade, Repeat.

The basic controller for the keyboard are:
*W, A, S, D for movement.
*Spacebar *Hold* for planting.
*E for choosing what seed to plant.

The basic controller for the ps4 controller is:
*Left Analog for movement.
*Square *Hold* for planting.
*Triangle for choosing what seed to plant.

For every chicken you killed, there will be a drop:
*Seeds, that can help you plant more crops.
*Apple, that can heal you.

You will also gain experience whenever you killed a chicken.
Earning enough exp will give you a Reward that you can you use to progress further like:
*Making your plants deal more damage.
*Making you move faster.
*Making your plant faster.
*And so on...

I also have some future plans to implement like:
*Add A Carrot Cannon that deals AOE damage to certain areas of chickens.
*Add Chilli Plant, which gives more move speed to chicken but deals more damage over time.
*Sunflower, which drops different boosters to the player.

I hope you will enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed creating it.
